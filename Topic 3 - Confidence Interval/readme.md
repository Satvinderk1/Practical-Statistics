# Topic 3 - Confidence Interval

## Introduction:
Practice different ways to build confidence interval for coffee dataset.

## Install:

- Python
- numpy
- Statsmodel

### 1. Traditional Confidence Intervals

- Build a confidence interval using the sampling distribution of the statistic that best estimates the parameter of interest. In this case, I used a sample mean height to estimate the population mean height.

### 2. Confidence Intervals- Part I

- More practice on building Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean.

### 3. Sampling Distributions - Difference in Means

- Build a confidence interval for the difference in the average heights.
