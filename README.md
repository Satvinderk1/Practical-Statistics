# Practical-Statistics

## Introduction:

Learn to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests
and building supervised learning models.

## Install:

- python
- numpy
- pandas 
- matplotlib
- statsmodel
- sklearn 

## Learning Objectives:

#### 1. Simpson’s Paradox
- Examine a case study to learn about Simpson’s Paradox

#### 2. Probability
- Learn the fundamental rules of probability.

#### 3. Binomial Distribution
- Learn about binomial distribution where each observation represents one of two outcomes
- Derive the probability of a binomial distribution

#### 4. Conditional Probability
- Learn about conditional probability, when events are not independent.

#### 5. Bayes Rule
- Build on conditional probability principles to understand the
Bayes rule
- Derive the Bayes theorem

#### 6. Standardizing
- Convert distributions into the standard normal distribution
using the Z-score.
- Compute proportions using standardized distributions.

#### 7. Sampling Distributions and Central Limit Theorem
- Use normal distributions to compute probabilities
- Use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in between values

#### 8. Confidence Intervals 
- Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence intervals

#### 9. Hypothesis Testing
- Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter.

#### 10. T-Tests and A/B Tests
- Test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups when we have small sample sizes

#### 11. Regression
- Build a linear regression model to understand the relationship
between independent and dependent variables.
- Use linear regression results to make a prediction.

#### 12. Multiple Linear Regression
- Use multiple linear regression results to interpret coefficients
for several predictors

#### 13. Logistic Regression 
- Use logistic regression results to make a prediction about the relationship between categorical dependent variables and
predictors.
